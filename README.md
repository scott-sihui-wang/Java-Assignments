# Java-Assignments

**Skills:** _Java_

This is a collection of assignments that I completed in the course of `Java Programming`.

For example, `ConvertNHighlighting` requires us to:

- Read and parse Java codes, and

- generate an HTML document which should be able to display `Java key words` in `dark blue`, `plain text` in `blue`, and `comments` in `green`.

The code can be found at `ConvertNHighlighting > src `. Below shows the result:

For _other_ assignments, the codes can similarily be found in `src` under the corresponding folers.
